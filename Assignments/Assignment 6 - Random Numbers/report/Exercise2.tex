\section*{Exercise 2}
For the built-in Matlab RNG, I have chosen to use the default settings: Mersenne Twister with seed 0.\\
The computations of the averages and standard deviation of total random numbers $10^{0}, 10^{1}, 10^{2}, 10^{3}, 10^{4}, 10^{5}, 10^{6}, 10^{7}$ and $10^{8}$ can be found in the following files:
\begin{itemize}
	\item rng\_test\_own.m
	\item rng\_test\_builtin.m
\end{itemize}
I could not go any higher than $10^{8}$, after this my PC started lagging really badly due to memory shortage.
The average we're looking for is obviously 0.5, whereas the standard deviation should be about 0.29.
Obviously, the more numbers we use, the more accurate we can expect the estimated average to be.

The code for the chi-square test can be found in the files:
\begin{itemize}
	\item chisquaretest\_own.m
	\item chisquaretest\_builtin.m
\end{itemize}

The Fourier-transform test can be found in fft\_analysis.m. Because we used a bad, short period RNG, the points in the plot are all clustered together. This signifies that the RNG is "not very random".
