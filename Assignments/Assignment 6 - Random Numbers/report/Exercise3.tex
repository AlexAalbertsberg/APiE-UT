\section*{Exercise 3}
The random walks are simulated by the following files:
\begin{itemize}
	\item randomwalk\_builtin.m
	\item randomwalk\_own.m
\end{itemize}
The outputs of these scripts are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Figure 1: Plot of $\langle x \rangle$.
	\item Figure 2: Fitted Gaussian plot and outputs mu and sigma (mean and standard deviation) in console (which are to be used as input for the Gaussian function of the form $\dfrac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{\dfrac{1}{2} (\dfrac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^{2}}$).
	\item Figure 3: Plot of $\langle x^{2} \rangle$.
\end{itemize}
