\part*{Exercise 1}
220 Ohm resistors have a 5\% tolerance, which means the tolerance is 0.05*220 = 11 Ohm.\\
10K Ohm resistors have a 5\% tolerance, which means the tolerance is 0.05*10000 = 500 Ohm.\\\\
Write down the resistor code for:\\
50K Ohm resistors with 10\% tolerance: Green-Black-Orange-Silver\\
1 Ohm resistor with 1\% tolerance: Brown-Black-Brown\\
450K Ohm resistor with 9K (or 20\%) tolerance: Yellow-Green-Yellow-NoBand\\\\
What is the value of the following resistors: \\
1000 Ohms with 5\% tolerance\\
11000 Ohms with 5\% tolerance (assuming the tolerance band is Gold).
